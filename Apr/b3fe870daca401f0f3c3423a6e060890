He hopes to have the biggest boxing match sometime soon in Nigeria being inspired by Mohammed Ali’s legendary fights.

We further discussed the company’s plans and how we are dedicated to the development of our great nation Nigeria for we believe that if it can be done outside the borders then it can be done back home. I urge every Nigerian at home and abroad to support the number one pride of Nigeria during his next fight sometime in June. We should give him all our support as we would do to Anthony Joshua – a true champion, the Nigerian Nightmare Kamaru Usman, and Isreal Adesanya – The Last Stylebender as they keep Nigeria on the GLOBAL MAP.
